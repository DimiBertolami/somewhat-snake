# somewhat-snake
not quite like the classic snake game
a bit of pacman in there too

i have now four ghosts chasing you shouting stuff to you. they speed up and slow down at (for now) fixed intervals
the game over logic is also not quite there yet.I want to overlay a big "GAME OVER" banner over the canvas.. hasn't happened yet so for now a simple popup will do
the ghosts are regenerated but are for some reason dead when I spawn them.. need to look into why that's happening.
